        If you&apos;re listed here, it&apos;s because your website showed standby

        <h2>How the list works</h2>
        <p>
          GeneratorInstallerList is a buyer-first directory of{' '}
          {TOTAL_INSTALLERS.toLocaleString()} installers across {TOTAL_STATES}{' '}
          states, sorted by real website signal, not which brand you carry.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            We search for generator installers state by state and dedupe by place
            ID.
          </li>
          <li>
            We crawl each installer&apos;s own website for standby generator
            signal: dedicated generator pages, repeated mentions, service scope.
          </li>
          <li>
            We assign a confidence tier and write a short listing so buyers can
            scan before they click through.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          A listing is not an endorsement. It is a better place to start for
          buyers who would otherwise begin from a blank search. Featured rows
          are labeled when they appear.
        </p>

        <h2>Get added</h2>
        <p>
          Missing from the list? Send the URL of the page on your site that shows
          standby generator installation work. We will check the signal and add
          you if it fits the directory standard.
        </p>

        <h2>Correct your entry</h2>
        <p>
          Phone number changed? Service area shifted? Wrong city? Send the
          correction with your listing URL or Google Maps link so we match the
          right profile.
        </p>

        <h2>Improve your signal</h2>
        <p>
          The list sorts by website signal. A dedicated standby generator page,
          clear scope (install and service), photos, and process content help
          buyers, and may improve your tier on the next research pass.
        </p>

        <h2>Get removed</h2>
        <p>
          Don&apos;t want to be listed? Send a removal request with your listing
          URL. We take it down within a few business days.
