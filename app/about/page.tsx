        GeneratorInstallerList is a working list of{' '}
        {TOTAL_INSTALLERS.toLocaleString()} standby-generator-friendly installers
        across {TOTAL_STATES} states. It exists because the first question most
        buyers ask is also the messiest one: who is actually worth calling? We
        do not care which brand you land on. We care whether the installer has
        real generator experience.
      </p>

      <div className="prose-content mt-10">
        <h2>Our standard</h2>
        <p>
          Every installer on this list shows standby generator signal on their
          own website: a dedicated generator page, repeated mentions, or clear
          install-and-service scope. We do not treat a listing as an
          endorsement. We treat it as a better place to start.
        </p>
        <p>Installers fall into confidence tiers sorted by signal strength:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Explicit:</strong> dedicated standby generator page, the
            strongest signal we track.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>High:</strong> repeated generator mentions across the site.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Medium:</strong> at least one clear mention, worth verifying
            on a first call.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The method</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Statewide search.</strong> Multiple terms per state,
            covering generator installer, standby generator, whole-house
            generator, and related labels. Different companies use different
            language, and we are not partial to any single manufacturer&apos;s
            terminology.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dedupe by place ID.</strong> The same company appears under
            multiple searches. We collapse duplicates so the list stays usable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Website crawl.</strong> We follow internal pages and look for
            generator signal where buyers would check: services, FAQs, galleries.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Confidence scoring.</strong> Dedicated pages first. Repeated
            mentions next. Single mentions after that.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Editorial review.</strong> We drop obvious mismatches and keep
            entries that give buyers a plausible next call.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Freshness</h2>
        <p>
          Website and review evidence for the national directory was last
          checked in <strong>August 2026</strong>. Profile copy may paraphrase
          public website language; credential claims such as licensed,
          certified, or authorized dealer status are not independently verified
          here — confirm them directly with the shop and the manufacturer.
        </p>

        <h2>What we&apos;re not</h2>
        <p>
          We&apos;re not a marketplace, not a lead-gen funnel, and not a
          contractor verification program. We have not met most of the
          installers on the list. Ask for references, verify licenses, and read
          contracts carefully. Good installers expect those questions.
        </p>
        <h2>Buyer guides</h2>
        <p>
          The directory gives you a place to start. Our{' '}
          <Link href="/guides">buyer guides</Link> cover installed cost, sizing,
          fuel, permits, and hiring, grounded in research, not dealer marketing.
          We lead with durable principles, and dated figures carry the year.
